        <p><strong>Limnological Baseline  Studies</strong><br />
          <br />
In some cases little is known about the physical, chemical,  and biological nature of a water resource; available field data is  limited.&nbsp;A &quot;problem&quot; (such as taste and odor, shortened filter  runs, algae blooms, weed infestation, fish kills...) is recognized, but data is  not available to identify potential or likely causes.&nbsp;A very focused  &quot;baseline study&quot; can be very useful in such cases, to define the  nature of the system, potential causes of problems, and develop a scope for  more detailed study to identify restoration methods.&nbsp;Rather than embark on  a comprehensive DFS, performing a baseline analysis can avoid doing unnecessary  and costly study aspects.</p>
        <p><strong>Watershed Management  Planning</strong><br />
          <br />
          We believe an effective Watershed Management Plan:&nbsp;Must  be equitable to all within the watershed (avoid the &quot;taking  issue&quot;);&nbsp;Must be developed with involvement by all stakeholders  (broadly accepted); and Must have a sound basis in Science!&nbsp;For these  reasons we developed a Quantitative Watershed Management Approach based on  Nutrient Allocation that is established by a Local Watershed Task Force with  broad representation.</p>
        <p><strong>Client-Based  Monitoring Programs </strong><br />
          <br />
          Hiring professional consultants to perform all field  collections of water samples, and other resource testing and observation is not  economical.&nbsp;However, expertise is needed to identify what needs to be  done, how to do it, and for evaluation and interpretation of  results.&nbsp;There is no substitute for having experienced &quot;expert  eyes&quot; performing field tests at key times.&nbsp;Yet costs to have all  necessary monitoring performed by a professional consultant can be  prohibitive.&nbsp;ECS, Inc. has overcome that dilemma by establishing  &quot;Client-Based Monitoring Programs&quot;.&nbsp;We provide training,  sampling design, equipment, overnight shipping arrangements (to an analytical  lab), data management, on-going fax-back advice, interpretation, and  reporting.&nbsp;In short, consulting fees go toward &quot;needed  expertise&quot;;&nbsp;costs for collecting water samples, travel time, etc. are  controlled! This program has worked extremely well for over 15 years, for Water  Supply Utilities, Lake Associations, and individuals.&nbsp;There is another  benefit, perhaps even more important than cost savings!&nbsp;The Client becomes  actively involved in the study.&nbsp;When results are presented, the Client  understands much more about the ecosystem and what the recommendations  mean.&nbsp;Prudent decision-making is facilitated!&nbsp;For information  regarding Client-Based Monitoring click HERE.</p>
