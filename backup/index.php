We describe our Research, Consulting, and Implementation work over the past 30 years. &nbsp;We have also made selected publications, technical  information, and several diagnostic Excel spreadsheets readily available for download. </p>
            <p>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying and conducting limnology research  for eight years at Rutgers and the University of Connecticut, I began to focus on restoring the quality of damaged lake ecosystems, and managing water quality in supply reservoirs in anticipation of treatment and supply distribution. Avoiding blooms of Cyanobacteria (bluegreen algae), restoring habitat for a viable food web, and water supply limnology have been my primary areas of research and development since 1980 when I founded <strong><em>Ecosystem Consulting Service, Inc.</em></strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;We provide &quot;state of the art&quot; lake  and reservoir restoration and management.&nbsp;Our professional staff  specializes in applied &quot;problem solving limnology&quot;. Our approach to  reservoir and lake management has always been based in science, for which  we have received a number of prestigious Technology Innovation and Scientific  Publication Awards.</p>
            <p><em><strong>The task of technology is not to correct Nature, but to imitate it.  </strong></em></p>
            <p>Diagnosing and correcting the causes of water quality problems is the goal of our work.  To accomplish that goal we often find the &quot;healthy natural features&quot; of a lake or reservoir ecosystem of critical importance, and utility.  Once the natural features and problem causes are understood  we develop a cost-effective plan to solve specific water quality  problems.</p>
<p>I hope you find the information on our site helpful. If we can be of assistance please contact us. </p>
