    <h1>Consulting <hr /></h1>
    <p><img src="images/image001.png" alt="sampling" width="255" height="217" border="1" align="left" />Ecosystem Consulting Service, Inc. established the Research Division to diagnose causes of lake and reservoir water quality degradation, eutrophication impacts, and habitat loss, and to prescribe effective treatments and management approaches. We conduct a variety of studies ranging from &quot;Second Opinion Reviews&quot; to complete multi-year Diagnostic-Feasibility Studies. Most often we recommend a &quot;Limnological Baseline Study&quot; consisting of a review of available information, several samplings at critical times, and preparation of a &quot;Review Report&quot; which identifies the basic nature of the ecosystem, healthy attributes, causes of water quality problems, and those  approaches which offer the most cost-effective management potential. Then informed decisions can be made regarding further work. </p>
    <p>We often establish a &quot;Client-Based Monitoring Program&quot; to collect additional data and information as cost-effectively as possible. With some training and equipment set-up, Water Utility Staff, Lake Residents, Engineering Company Personnel, etc. can gather samples and observations about a water resource.  That saves the cost of our Professional Limnology Staff doing tasks that can be done  more cost-effectively locally. Our professional services time is spent on the technical limnology aspects- diagnosis, feasibility assessments, implementation design and cost-estimation.  We have a number of long-standing annual monitoring programs with lake associations and water utilities; samples are shipped overnight FedEx directly to the lab for chemical analyses, field data is emailed directly to us for review and advise.</p>
    <p><a href="watersupply.html"><img src="images/MDC Res6 Intake Baffle.JPG" alt="Intake" width="131" height="112" align="left" />Water Supply Limnology</a><br />
    Our work in Water Supply Limnology focuses on the unique characteristics and management goals of surface water supply sources. We evaluate surface water source reservoirs relative to intake locations (longitudinal and vertical), reservoir characteristics, and how raw water quality effects a particular water treatment process. Reservoir Management focus is on  Raw Water Quality in anticipation of Water Treatment.</p>
    <p><a href="lakesandreservoirs.html"><img src="images/View of Gardner Lake.JPG" alt="Gardner" width="135" height="80" align="left" />Lake Restoration</a><br />
      Our Lake Restoration Limnology work focuses on restoring and preserving water quality, habitat availability, and ecological integrity. Our specialty is restoration of eutrophic lakes that exhibit blooms of Cyanobacteria, and restoration of cool water habitat for cold water fish (Salmonids) and zooplankton refuge (<em>Daphnia sp</em>.). </p>
    <p><a href="services.html"><img src="images/125_2520.JPG" alt="waraSunset" width="135" height="119" align="left" />Watershed Management</a><br /> 
    Lakes and Reservoirs are &quot;<em>Mirrors of the Landscape</em>&quot;: their quality reflects the quality of water flowing in from the watershed drainage basin. Many management approaches are available to reduce the impacts of watershed loading from runoff and groundwater. We help a client to develop a watershed management approach that is suitable to their particular setting. We developed a Spreadsheet-based Nutrient Allocation Approach to Long-Term Watershed Management (many years before the EPA-TMDL Program was established). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="cooperativeresearch.html">Cooperative Research</a>  We have provided Professional  Limnology Consulting Services as a sub-contractor to many international, national, and regional environmental engineering companies that do not have a professional limnologist on staff. We have also participated in applied research projects with Universities, US Environmental Agencies, the Canada Ministry of the Environment, Water Utilities, and Lake Associations. We welcome the opportunity to provide the applied limnology expertise needed to achieve a successful water resource improvement project.</p>
