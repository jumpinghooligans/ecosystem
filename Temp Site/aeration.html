        <p>Oxygen loss can have significant consequences in a lake of water supply reservoir. Oxygen loss can increase nutrient availability via internal loading. It can eliminate critical habitat which purturbs the food-web and the &quot;natural balance&quot; between producers and consumers. It can result in the accumulation of anaerobic respiration products (especially Fe and Mn) and can cause serious water supply treatment problems. However, not all oxygen results in serious impacts, some anaerobiosis can actually be very good. </p>
        <p>Although you will find dozens of &quot;Aeration Vendors&quot;, there are only <em>three</em> fundemental Aeration Methods available for lakes and  reservoirs:</p>
        <p>1. Eliminate Thermal Stratification by mixing the warm surface layer to the bottom;</p>
        <p>2. Subsidize Oxygen Input to the cold water below the thermocline; and</p>
        <p>3. Circulate a Specific Depth Range to redistribute available oxygen and heat.</p>
        <p><strong>1. <a href="artificialcirculation.html">Artificial  Circulation</a></strong> (commonly referred to as &quot;destratification&quot;). This  method mixes the entire water column, preventing the development of a warm  water layer floating on colder water. The method can be implemented using  diffused air (&quot;bubblers&quot;), mechanical mixers, or other  devices.&nbsp;Artificial Circulation can be very useful during specific seasons  (for example to extend Spring mixing), to expand the depth of natural mixing of  the surface epilimnion layer, or to control how a lake or reservoir mixes in the  Fall.&nbsp;It is also useful to control metals accumulation in storage  reservoirs.&nbsp;Artificial Circulation is usually not the best approach for  direct supply reservoirs, or deep lakes, because it eliminates depth-selective  supply withdrawal capability, significantly increases bottom temperatures,  eliminates important cool water habitat, can accelerate respiration rates  (increasing oxygen demand at the sediment-water interface), and can have other  related adverse impacts.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>2. <a href="hypoaeration.html">Hypolimnetic Aeration</a></strong> increases delivery of dissolved oxygen to the cold water layer below the  thermocline without disrupting stratification or warming the bottom.&nbsp;The  method can be implemented using several types of hypolimnetic aeration towers  (full-lift or partial-lift), oxygenation systems using liquid oxygen or on-site  oxygen generators, or side-stram systems.&nbsp;Hypolimnetic Aeration is a very  good approach in deeper lakes or reservoirs, to maintain high quality cold  water for supply, restoring cold water habitat, and reducing internal nutrient  loading due to hypolimnetic anoxia.&nbsp;In reservoirs and lakes where oxygen  loss ascends above the thermocline metalimnetic (mid-depth) oxygen loss is  likely to persist despite an aerobic hypolimnion.</p>
        <p><strong>3. <a href="layeraeration.html">Layer Aeration</a></strong> is  the most recent method developed for lakes and reservoirs. This method  circulates a mid-depth water layer (designed using a heat and oxygen mass  budget).&nbsp;The natural thermocline-metalimnion zone is focused above and  below the aerated layer; stratification is preserved.&nbsp;By designing the  upper extent of the Aerated Layer above the depth where photosynthesis produces  a net excess of dissolved oxygen, the method actually uses the biology of a  lake to aerate deeper waters.&nbsp;Layer Aeration is very effective for  restoring cold water habitat immediately below the epilimnion, for creating and  maintaining high quality raw supply water layers (below algae and above anoxia  and metals), and for reducing internal nutrient loading and transport to  productive surface waters.</p>
        <p>There are many variations of these three basic Methods (DownFlow  Systems, <a href="solaraeration.html">Solar Driven Systems</a>, etc.).&nbsp;Ecosystem Consulting Service has  over 25 years of experience with implementing, operating, and maintaining each  of these aeration methods.&nbsp;No other company has  experience  with <em>all</em> of these aeration methods.&nbsp;A diagnostic evaluation is needed to  identify which method, or integrated combination, is best for a specific  reservoir, lake, and intended resource use.</p></td>
